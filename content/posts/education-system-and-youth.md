###### I write this as when India has successfully landed and is carrying out it's Chandrayan-3 mission.
###### India has become the first country to land on Moon's South Pole, I'd like to congratulate all the people who were involved in this mission.

Anyway, I stumbled upon this old essay from 1999, the title is "INDIAN TALENT CAUGHT IN THE COBWEBS",
It mentions how Indian society in general resists change.

> The inability to assimilate and adopt new knowledge by a society which is otherwise extremely lively, vibrant, intelligent and knowledgeable seems strange. 
> To a casual observer, there seems to be no reason that a society, fully aware of the latest developments in technology and conceptual thoughts, 
> could have failed repeatedly to use its knowledge in its day-to-day operations. 
> More strange than even the historical realities is the fact that the same situation continues even today to some degree.

It's sad that even in 2023 this essay holds true about the condition of Indian society. It's a must read: https://www.samarthbharat.com/cobwebs.htm

This brings me to the topic of this blog post, The Indian education system puts huge emphasis on getting "marks" no one talks about knowledge 
or innovation. This system explicitly discourages curiosity among the youth. 

### Today's Youth

We all have heard the stories of the older generation, how they used to spend their time roaming and playing outside.

What is today's youth doing then? "Instagram Reels" "Youtube Shorts". 
Today's youth spends most of their time scrolling endlessly on their mobile phones. 

This has more impact on their mental health than they realize. These short format videos increase level of impatience in people,
reduces focus and converts the curious and remarkable thing called "human brain" into a dopamine seeker that craves for the easiest way to get dopamine. 

###### A simple example of this, in my classroom the teacher was dictation notes and we were writing. He was dictating at an exteremly reasonable pace, yet most of the students were unable to keep up with this. 

Reason? these platforms have reduced the concentration of youth so much that they are unable to remember a word that 
was uttered literally 10 seconds ago, this is not a joke.

Okay, but surely not *everyone* is waste their time like this right? Yes. 
Those who are focused on their careers are studying, but what? **JEE**

Good rank in Joint Entrance Exams (JEE) is required for students who want to purse engineering to get admission in IITs 
(Indian Institutue Of Technology) these exams are highly unrealistic and pointless. Sometimes the students get so depressed 
and pressurized that they commit suicide, there have been a lot of student suicides due to JEE. 
The city "Kota" in Rajasthan is the hub of this "rat race".

They only exist to "filter out" people. The highly competetive nature of these exams actually damages curiosity 
and the will to learn in students. 

Okay say you got admission into IIT or other engineering college, you actually benefit from the things taught there right??? 
Nope. 

The syllabus in the engineering colleges is so outdated that it simply can't compete with the pace that technology grows. 
Again the focus is on by-hearting the syllabus and gaining marks, no one talks about innovation and R&D. 

The Indian "talent" wastes time in doing pointless things like college projects (which aren't practical atall and most copy from the internet)

The education system needs a major reform, The Government Of India has introduced NEP (National Education Policy) that *attempts* 
to fix this problem, but I don't see this improving things as of now.

That was about the people who are motivated to get a job and earn money. 
But surprisingly, there are people who want to do.. *nothing* 
They have no purpose, no motivation in life. 

### "Lack Of Jobs" 

I see young people complaining about lack of jobs (on TV). They say thousands of "engineers" in India and jobless. 
But are they really *engineers*? 
Let's see the definition of an engineer. 

>  Engineers, as practitioners of engineering, are professionals who invent, design, analyze, build and test machines, complex systems, structures, gadgets and materials to fulfill functional objectives

Do you think these so called *engineers* who graduate from colleges fit this definition? 

Personally, I think it's not the lack of jobs in engineering, rather it's just that these people lack the skillset required to be hired. 
Indian talent is stuck in "cobwebs" doing pointless things. 

In the days of British colonial rule, people suffered from poverty and supression from the British so they were not able to learn 
and hampered the growth of Indians. But this mostly isn't the case now, people just don't want to learn even when they have all the resources 
in the world. 

Before the Internet, access to information was a big issue, again now this simply isn't the problem. 
Literally everyone in India has a smartphone and access to affordable internet.

The sad reality is that spirit of engineering seems to be dead :\

We must ask ourselves, why do these *engineers* do not have the proper skillsets? Because the education system here is not based 
upon real-world practical knowledge. Most of the engineers who are successful in their career are due to self-taught knowledge. 
What we can do is encourage curiosity and motivate youngsters to learn themselves. 

I was invited to give a guest lecture to 2nd year students of a polytechnic college a few days ago, it felt nice to interact with these people 
and I was proud that I was able to make these people curious about technology!

The topic of my lecture was "Introduction to Hacking" and I discussed and taught the basic skills required and give them a *gist* of what hacking is. 

Anyway, this the end of my RANT / mind-dump. 

Thank you for reading! 

P.S again, the essay linked on the top is a must read for everyone, it's very well written.
