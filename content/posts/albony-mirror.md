# The albony.xyz linux mirror
## How it all started: 
#### One day, I was just sitting bored, so I did a thing that every arch linux user does when they are bored :P updating their system,
```sh
sudo pacman -Syyu
```
*errors out* 
#### Turns out... all mirrors in my mirrorlist were facing problems, then I thought.. maybe I should host my own?



## mirror.albony.xyz
#### And here we are, around three months later: currently mirroring 5 repositories.
(archlinux, raspberry pi os, manjaro, blackarch, chaotic-aux)
#### I get more than **7TB in traffic** and more than **6 Million requests** per month, 
#### and around 1TB every week, sometimes even more. I have gotten a very positive feedback about the mirror, "It's wayy faster than any other mirror" :)
#### *and.. it's hosted on a thinkpad from 2011, with an i3 2310m in my house* it can't handle more now, I am limited by both the CPU and storage capacity. 
#### My hard drive is nearly full, so I can't host more now. That's why I am asking for help from y'all.
