#### How to make proxmox UI beautiful 
 I use proxmox daily for virtual machines and LCX containers,
 It is one of the best virtual machince platform that utilizes KVM
*And it's FOSS*

but the default UI is too bright and "dark mode" looks cool :D
#### Discord-PVE
Discord-PVE is a "discord theme" for the proxmox virtual environment 
it uses custom stylesheet
This looks soo much better

(This was in my personal notes, I thought maybe I could put it in a blog post)                `¯¯ \_(ツ)_/¯`
