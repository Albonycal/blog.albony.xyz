## MIRROR.ALBONY.IN 

It has been a while since I updated about the infra architecture of my mirror, it has changed quite a bit since then. 
I have wanted to have a load balancer for my mirrors for a long time

## Running A Free Software Mirror

I have been hosted a free software mirror since 2021, It has been quite a journey and I learnt a lot about technology in general since then. 
The very philosophy of FOSS is that it is open and accessible to everyone. And we, the mirror operators play a key role in ensuring that this 
accessibility is maintained. 

India is a vast country, and with increasing popularity of FOSS more and more mirrors are needed, when compared to other countries we have very few mirrors.
