I run a non-profit FOSS mirror service which serves thousands of people daily.

India is a vast country, and with increasing popularity of FOSS more and more mirrors are needed, when compared to other countries we have very few mirrors.
We are working to improve the situation.

Currently we have a mirror node in three cities in India. Nagpur, Mumbai and Chennai. We are working on deploying another mirror node in Hyderabad. 


For this we need the help of FOSS community. 

Currently we are running a fund raiser to help raise funds to arrange storage for HYD node, along with upgrading the current capacity of NAG node.
