My Name is Shrirang Kahale. I'm a 16 y/o, I have a strong interest in Networking, ethical hacking, penetration testing, firmware analysis and network security. I'm also experienced in working with Linux-based servers and enjoy tinkering with them to improve my skills.

I go by the alias "albony" online.
