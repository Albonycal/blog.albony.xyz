I'm a 18 y/o who has a strong interest in Networking, DevOps, firmware analysis and technology in general. I'm also experienced in working with Linux-based servers and enjoy tinkering with them to improve my skills.

I am a believer of the free software philosophy and I contribute to FOSS by hosting a distributed mirror service (mirror.albony.in) 
which serves more than 20TB of traffic per day. 


I go by the alias "albony" / "albonycal" on the internet.
